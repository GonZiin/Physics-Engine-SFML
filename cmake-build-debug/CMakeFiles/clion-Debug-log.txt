CMake Warning (dev) at /app/extra/clion/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:441 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Macros.cmake:279 (find_package)
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/src/SFML/Audio/CMakeLists.txt:70 (sfml_find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
